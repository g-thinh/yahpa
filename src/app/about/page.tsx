          YAHPA (Young Asian Health Professionals Association) was founded in
          the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020 to support
          Asian communities in Quebec facing challenges due to misinformation,
          language barriers, and limited access to healthcare. A dedicated group
          of healthcare professionals and students came together to create
          coronavirus information guides, develop community resource lists, and
          translate health announcements into languages like Mandarin,
          Cantonese, and Vietnamese. YAHPA aims to improve healthcare access,
          quality, and equity for Asian seniors and unilingual immigrants,
          addressing language barriers and reducing disparities in care.
